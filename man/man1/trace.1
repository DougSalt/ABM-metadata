.SH "NAME"
\fBtrace\.sh\fR \- draws diagrams tracing a single entity
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
trace\.sh [\-\-colour] [\-\-exclude]\.\.\. [include]\.\.\. input_file entity output_file
.
.P
A small program to recursively filter on the dot produced by SSREPI programs\. This will first allow you to trace a particular entity through the directed graph, and secondly filter on the entities you want to look at\.
.
.P
This takes three positional parameters\. These are mandatory
.
.IP "1." 4
The input dot file that needs filtering
.
.IP "2." 4
The token we are concentrating on tracking or colouring
.
.IP "3." 4
The output dot file which will then need processing by graphviz\.
.

.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This takes a single instance and traces it through a diagram that has been produced from the SSREPI data\. This can be used to trace things that are affected by a given entity\. For instance if an original data set was in error and then we could trace the result data sets affected in that run\.
.
.P
This command works on diagrams that are produced from the following:
